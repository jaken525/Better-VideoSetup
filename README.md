# Better VideoSetup
New VideoSetup program for Beetle Crazy Cup.

All screen resolutions supported by your monitor are available in the program. An additional improvement is also built in in the form of an already fully configured dgVoodoo. The game can be run with stable FPS and all visual effects.

It is enough to simply place the program in the root folder of the game.
The main menu will remain at 4:3 at 640 x 480
